Columbo  (/kəˈlʌmboʊ/) is an American crime drama televisio n series starring Peter Falk as
Lieutenant Columb o, a homicide detective  with the Los Angeles Police Department .[2][3] After two
pilot episodes in 1968 and 1971, the show originally aired on NBC  from 1971 to 1978 as one of the
rotating programs of The NBC Mystery Movie . Columbo  then aired less frequently on ABC  from
1989 to 2003.
Columbo is a shre wd and intelligent blue-collar  hom icide detective whose trademar ks include his
rumpled beige raincoat, unassuming demeanor, cigar, old Peugeot 403 car,[4][5][6] love of chili ,
and unseen wife  (whom he mentions frequently). He often leaves a room only to return with the
catchphrase  "Just one more thing" to ask a critical question.
The character and show, created by Richard Levinson  and William Link , popularized the inverted
detective story  format (sometimes referred to as a "howcatchem"). This genre begins by showing
the commission of the crime and its perpetrator; the plot therefore usually has no "whodunit "
element of determ ining which of several suspects committed the crime. It instead revolves around
how a perpetrator  known to the audience will finally be caught and exposed. The clues Columbo
finds to help him solve the case are sometimes revealed to the audience beforehand, but often not
until the episode’s end.
The series' homicide  suspects are often affluent members of high society; it has led some critics to
see class conflict as an element of each story.[7] Suspects  carefully cover their tracks and are
initially dismissive  of Columbo's circumstantial speech and apparent ineptitude. They become
increasingly unsettled as his superficially pestering behavior teases out incriminating evidence.[7]
His relentless approach often leads to self-incrimination  or outright confession.
Episodes of Columbo  are between 70 and 98 minutes long, and they have been broadcast in 44
countries. The show has been described by the BBC  as "timeless" and remains popular today.[8]

After two pilot episodes, the show originally aired on NBC  from 1971 to 1978 as one of the rotat ing
programs of The NBC  Mystery  Movie . Columbo  then aired less regularly on ABC  beginnin g in
1989 under the umbrella of The ABC Mystery Movie .[9] The last episode was broadcast in 2003 as
part of ABC Thursday Night at the Movies .[10]
In almos t every episode, the audience sees the crime unfold at the beginning and knows the
identity of the culprit, typically an affluent member of society. Once Columbo enters the story (he
rarely appears in the first act), viewers watch him solve the case by sifting through the
contradictions between the truth and the version presented to him by the killer(s). This style of
mystery is sometimes referred to as a "howcatchem ", in contrast to the traditional whodunit . In
structural analysis terms, the majority of the narrative is therefore dénouement , a feature
normally reserved for the very end of a story. Episodes tend to be driven by their characters, the
audience observing the criminal's reactions to Columbo's increasingly intrusive presence.
When Columbo first appears in an episode, his genius is hidden from the viewer by his frumpy, friendly, and disarming demeanor.
While the details, and eventually the motivations, of the murderers' actio ns are always shown to the viewer, Columbo's true thoughts
and inten tions are sometimes concealed until the end of the episode. He occasionally begins to whistle the tune "This Old Man " as theEpisodes22.09.2023, 13:33 Columbo - Wikipedia

Columbo generall y maintains a friendly relationship with the murderer until the end, and
sometimes even after their confessi on or incrimination, despite both characters being aware of
their adversarial positions. The detective usually suspects the murderer within moments of their
meeting, or even earlier, often based on their reaction to the news of the victim's death. The
murderer in turn almost always immediately sees through Columbo's scruffy and absent-minded
manner to his underlying investigative intellect, and accordingly takes steps to divert his efforts by
disguising evidenc e, manipulating witnesses, manufacturing evidence to lead Columbo towards a
different suspect, and/or feigning irritation as an excuse for declining requests for searches and
interrogations. In some cases the murderer will even taunt Columbo over his inability to prove
their guilt. There are two sides to Columbo's character: the disarming and unkempt detective and
the hidden genius sleuth. The genius  sometimes starkly manifests itself through his eyes, as when
the magician The Great Santini escapes from police handcuffs that Columbo coyly presents him
during Santini's show ("Now You See Him..."). In some instances, such as the avenging elderly
mystery writer in "Try and Catch Me" and the terminally ill and deluded actress in "Forgotten
Lady", many viewers find the killer more sympathetic than the victim.[11]
Each episode is generally concluded with Columbo proving the killer's guilt, though some episodes,
such as "Swan Song", go on to show the killer confessing or quietly subm itting to arrest. There are
few attem pts to deceive the viewer or provide a twist in the tale. One exception is "Last Salute to
the Commodore", where Robert Vaughn  is seen elaborately  disposing of a body, but is proved later
to have been covering for his alcoholic wife, whom he mistakenly thought to be the murderer.[12]
Sometimes, Colum bo sets up the murderer with a trick designed to elicit a confession. An example
occurs in "Dagger of the Mind", in which Columbo flips an evidentia ry pearl into the victim's
umbrella, bringing about incriminating activity from Nicholas Frame and Lillian Stanhope.
The character of Columbo was created by the writing team of Richard Levinson  and William Link,
who said that Columbo was partially inspired by Fyodor Dostoevsky 's Crime and Punish ment
character Porfiry Petrovich,[13][14] as well as G. K. Chesterton 's humble  cleric-detective Father
Brown . Other sources claim Columbo's character is also influenced by Inspector Fichet from the
French suspense-thriller film Les Diaboliques  (1955).[15]
The character first appeared in a 1960 episode of the television-anthology series The Chevy
Mystery Show,  titled "Enough Rope". This was adapted by Levinson and Link from their short
story "Ma y I Come In", which had been published as "Dear Corpus Delicti" in an issue of Alfred
Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine . The short story featured a police lieutenant then named Fisher.[16]
The first actor to portray Columbo, character actor Bert Freed , was a stocky character actor with a
thatch of gray hair.[17]
Freed's Columbo wore a rumpled suit and smoked a cigar; he otherwise had few of the other now-
familiar Columbo mannerisms. The character is still recognizably Colum bo and uses some of the
same methods of misdirecting and distracting his suspects. During the course of the show, the
increasingly frigh tened murderer brings pressure from the district attorney's office to have
Columbo taken off the case, but the detective fights back with his own contacts.
Although Freed received third billing, he wound up with almost as much screen time as the killer
and appe ared imm ediately after the first commercial. This delayed entry  of the character into the
narrative of the screen play became a defining characteristic of the struct ure of the Columbo series.
This telep lay is available for viewing in the archives of the Paley Center for Media  in New York City
and Los Angeles.
Levinson and Link then adapted the TV drama into the stage play Prescription: Murder.  This was
first perfo rmed at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco on January 2, 1962, with Oscar -winning
character actor Thomas Mitchell  in the role of Columbo. Mitchell was 70 years old at the time. The
stage production starred Joseph Cotten  as the murderer and Agnes Moorehead  as the victim.
Mitchell died of cancer while the play was touring in out-of-town tryouts; Columbo was his last
role.
In 1968, the same play was made into a two-hour television movie that aired on NBC. The writers
suggested Lee J. Cobb  and Bing Crosby  for the role of Columbo, but Cobb was unavailable and
Crosby turned it down because he felt it would take too much time away from the golf links. Director Richard Irving  convinced
Levinson and Link that Falk, who excitedly said he "would kill to play that cop", could pull it off even though he was much younger
than the writers had in mind.[18]
Originally a one-off movie of the week , Prescription: Mur der has Falk's Columbo pitted against a psychiatrist (Gene Barry). In this
movie, the psychiatrist gives the new audience a perfect description of Columbo's character. Due to the success of this film, NBC
requested that a pilot for a potential series be made to see if the charact er could be sustained on a regular basis, leading to the 1971
90-minute television production, Ransom for a Dead Man , with Lee Gran t playing the killer. The popularity of the second film
prompted the creation of a regular series on NBC, that premiered in September 1971 as part of The NBC Mystery Movie  wheel series
rotation: McCloud , McMillan & Wife , and other whodunits .Development and character profile
