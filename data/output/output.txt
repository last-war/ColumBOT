Abstract  
Cyber Security accepts a vigorous role in the area of information technology. Safeguarding the 
information has become an enormous  problem in the current day. The cybersecurity  the main thing 
that originates in mind is 'cyber crimes' which are aggregate col ossally daily. Different governments 
and organizations are taking numerous measures to  keep these cyber wrongdoings. Other than 
different measures cybersecurity  is as yet a significant  worry to many. This paper mostly  emphases  
on cyber  security and cyber t errorism. The significant  trends of cybersecurity  and the consequence 
of cybersecurity  discuss in it.  The cyber -terrorism could make associations lose billions of dollars in 
the region of organizations . The paper also explains  the components of cyber terr orism and 
motivation of it. Two case studies related to cybersecurity  also provide in this paper. Some solution 
about cyber  security and cyber terrorism also explain in it.  
 
Keywords:  Cybersecurity; cyberspace; cyber terrorism; Information security . 
 
 
1. Introduction  
Today an individual can receive and send any information may be video, or 
an email or only through the click of a button but did s/he ever ponder how safe  
this information transmitted to another individual strongly with no spillage of 
data ? The proper  response lies in cybersecurity. Today more than  61% of full 
industry exchanges are done on the internet, so this area prerequisite high  quality 
of security for direct and best exchanges. Thus, cybersecurity  has become a most 
recent issue ( Dervo jeda, et. all., 2014) . The extent of cybersecurity does not 
merely restrict  to verifying the data in IT industry yet also to different fields like 
cyberspace  and so forth. Improving cybersecurity and ensuring that necessary  
data systems are vital to each c ountry's security and financial pro sperity.

Creating the Internet safer (and safeguarding Internet clients) has become 
to be  essential  to the improvement of new management  just as a legislative  
strategy. The encounter against cybercrime needs an extensive and more  secure 
practice  (Gross, Canetti & Vashdi, 2017) . The  particular estimates alone cannot  
keep any crime ; it is essential  that law authorization offices are allowable to 
investigation and  indict cybercrime efficiently. Nowadays numerous countries and 
administrations are compelling strict rules on cyber safeties to keep the loss of 
some vital data. Each  should be equipped on this cybersecurity and save 
themselves fro m these increasing cyber crimes.  
Cyber -security is both about the insecurity made by and through this new 
space and about the practices or procedures to make it (progressively) secure 
(Kumar, & Somani, 2018) . It alludes to a lot of exercises and measures, both 
specialized and non- specialized, expected to ensure the bioelectrical condition 
and the information it contains and transports from all possible threats.  This 
research aims to gather all the information and overview related to cyber- crime 
and provide the historical facts and perform reports on the analyzed data of different attacks reported everywhere in the last five years. Based on the analyzed informatio n, we would like to provide all the countermeasures that organizations 
may undertake in order to ensure improved security that would support in defending the organizations from being attacked by the hackers and provide a cyber -security to avoid all risks.  
 
2. Purpose  
      The paper provides information  about cyber  security and cyber 
terrorism. It covers various information about these topics  in its subsections. 
Trends of cybersecurity and the role  of social media in cybersecurity define in this 
paper. The pap er provides some necessary  information about cyber  terrorism. The 
components of “cyber terrorism” and the consequences  of this terrorism also 
explain in this paper. There are some examples of case studies those related to 
cybersecurity. The paper also prov ides some solutions regarding cyber  security 
and cyber terrorism. It provides some techniques for  preventing cyber terrorism. 
The future study and scope of cybersecurity  define in it.  
Cybersecurity has become a major concern over the last 10 year in the IT 
world. In the present world, everybody is facing a lot of problems with cyber -
crime. As hackers are hacking major sensitive information from government and some enterprise organizatio ns the individuals are very much worried as cyber-
security assault can bring about everything from wholesale fraud, to blackmail big companies. They are many varieties of cyber -crimes emerging where everyone

needs to be aware of the scams and they are diff erent measures and tools which 
can be used for avoiding the cyber -crimes. Every organization wants to secure 
their confidential data from getting hacked.  Getting hacked is not just about losing 
the confidential data but losing the relationship with custom ers in the market 
(Bendovschi, 2015).  
The Internet is today's fastest growing infrastructure. In today's technical 
environment many new technologies are changing mankind. But due to these emerging technologies, we are unable to protect our private information in an efficient way, so the cyber -crimes are drastically increasing on daily basis. Majority 
of the transactions both commercial and personal are done using the means online transaction, so it is important to have an expertise who require a high quality of security maintaining a better transparency to everyone and having safer transactions. So cybersecurity is the latest issue. Advanced technologies like cloud 
services, mobiles, E -commerce, internet banking and many more they require a 
high standards and safer process of security. All the t ools and technologies 
involved for these transactions hold the most sensitive and cruicial user 
information. So providing the necessary security to them is very important. Improving the cybersecurity and safeguarding the sensitive data and infrastructures are important to every countries top priority security 
(Panchanatham, 2015) . 
 
3. Trends of Cyber Security  
     Cyber Security assumes a critical role in the area of data technology. 
Safeguarding the data have become the greatest difficulty in the current day . The 
cybersecurity the main thing that raids a chord is cybercrimes which are increasing 
tremendously step by step (Samuel, & Osman, 2014) . Different administrations 
and organizations are taking many measures to keep these cybercrimes. 
Additional the diff erent measures cybersecurity is as yet an enormous worry to 
numerous. Some main trends that are changing cybersecurity give as follows:  
 
3.1. Web servers  
The risk of assaults on web applications to separate information or to 
circulate malicious code perseveres. Cybercriminals  convey their code using  good  
web servers they have  traded off. In any case, information taking attacks, a 
considerable lot of which g et the deliberation of media, are also a significant  risk. 
Currently, individuals need a more unusual  accentuation on securing web servers 
 
117 
Unauthentifiziert   | Heruntergeladen  01.09.19 21:18   UTCHOLISTICA Vol 10 , Issue 2 , 201 9  
as well as web applications ( Bendovschi, 2015) . Web servers are mainly  the pre -
eminent stage for these cybercriminals  to take the information. Thus, one should 
reliably utilize an additional secure program, mainly  amid vital exchanges all 
together not to fall as a quarry  for these defilements.  
 
3.2. Mobile Networks  
The risk of assaults on web applications to separate informat ion or to 
circulate malicious code perseveres. Cybercriminals  convey their code using  good  
web servers they have  traded off. In any case, information taking attacks, a 
considerable lot of which get the deliberation of media, are also a significant  risk. 
Currently, individuals need a more unusual  accentuation on securing web servers 
as well as web applications ( Bendovschi, 2015) . Web servers are mainly  the pre -
eminent stage for these cybercriminals  to take the information. Thus, one should 
reliably utilize an additional secure program, mainly  amid vital exchanges all 
together not to fall as a quarry  for these defilements.  
 3.3. Encryption 
It is the method toward encoding messages so programmers cannot  
scrutinize it. In encryption, the message is encoded by encryption , changing it into 
a stirred -up figure content. It commonly completes with the use of an “encryption 
key,” that demonstrates how the message is to encode. Encryption at the earliest  
reference  point level secures information protection and its respectability 
(Sharma, 2012) . Additional use of encryption obtains more problems in  
cybersecurity. Encryption is used to ensure the information  in travel, for instance,  
the information  being exchanged using  systems (for example the Internet, online 
business), mobile phones, wireless radios and so on.  
 3.4. ADP’s and targeted attacks  
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a whole of the dimension  of cybercrime 
ware. For quite a long time network security capacities. For example, IPS or web 
filtering have had a key influence in distinguishing such focused -on assaults 
(Bendovschi, 2015) . As attackers become bolder and utilize increasingly dubious 
methods, network security must incorporate with other security benefits to 
identify assaults. Thus, one must recover our security procedures to counteract 
more dangers coming later on. Subsequently the above is  a portion of the patterns

changing the essence of cybersecurity on the planet. The top network threats are 
showin g in figure 1 .

4. Role of Social Media in Cyber Security  
Social media has turned into a lifestyle for some individuals. We use it to stay 
in contact, plan occasions, share our photographs and comment on recent 
developments. It has replaced email and telephone requires a ton of us. However, similarly as with what ever else on the web, it is imperative to know about the 
dangers. PCs, cell phones, and different gadgets are priceless assets that furnish people of any age with the extraordinary capacity to connect and collaborate with 
whatever remains of the world. Ind ividuals can do this in various ways, including 
the utilization of social media or networking sites.  
Courtesy of social media, people can share musings, pictures, exercises, or 
any part of their lives (Gross, Canetti & Vashdi, 2017) . They can bring an unk nown 
look into the lives of others, regardless of whether they live nearby or over the globe. Unfortunately, these networks additionally represent security toward one's 
PC, protection, and even their security. Social media collection among faculty is 
soaring as is the risk of assault (Sharma, 2012) . Since social media sites are nearly 
utilized by the majority of them reliably, it has become an excellent stage for cybercriminals for hacking private data and taking significant data.  
 
119 
Unauthentifiziert   | Heruntergeladen  01.09.19 21:18   UTCHOLISTICA Vol 10 , Issue 2 , 201 9  
The organizations need to assure they are likewise as fast in recognizing 
dangers, reacting increasingly, and keeping away from a rupture of any sort. 
Subsequently, individuals must take suitable measures particularly in managing social media to keep the loss of their data. The cap acity of persons to impart data 
to a group of persons of millions is at the core of the exact test that social media offerings to organizations (Cabaj, Kotulski, Księżopolski, & Mazurczyk, 2018) . 
Nevertheless, enabling anyone to disperse financially delica te data, social media 
additionally gives a comparable ability to range false data. It can be merely being as harming. The rapid spread of incorrect information by social media is among the growing dangers. Though social media can utilize for cybercrimes, t hese 
organizations cannot stand to quit utilizing social media as it assumes an essential role in the attention of an organization. In its place, they should have arrangements that will inform them of the risk to fix it before any actual harm is done Dervo jeda, Verzijl, Nagtegaal, Lengton, & Rouwmaat, 2014) . Anyway, 
organizations should understand this and observe the meaning of breaking down the data chiefly in social deliberations and give good security plans to avoid dangers. One must contract with socia l media by using specific plans and the right 
technologies.  
 
5. Cyber Terrorism  
The term “terrorism” can allude  to the illegal utilization of power or 
viciousness against people in order to threaten an administration or its residents 
and associations which might be to accomplish a political or a malicious  site [10]. 
Terrorism has transformed from the conventional  structure to the cyber type of 
innovation supported terrorism recognized  as cyber terrorism. It stays  vital issues 
of the present society. Not just that the battle against terrorism is falling behind, current cybercrime assaults are ending up progressively forceful and 
confrontational (Sharma, 2012) . This terrorism is the utilization of cyber word to 
dispatch an assault to the essential  foundations that the presence of associations 
and countries entirely  depended after that  can prompt its shut down.  
 
5.1. Components of Cyber Terrorism  
A few attacks as cyber terrorism have  a few parts which have  been 
distinguished by numerous observational researchers in the exploration network. 
As indicated by Samuel and Osman (2014) in their hypothetical model recognize the five  sections that a “cyber -terrorism” classified  they are; the objective of the 
violence, inspiration and dedication towards the mission to be accomplished when such incident takes place,  impact, instruments are utilized to dispatch such assault 
 
120 
Unauthentifiziert   | Heruntergeladen  01.09.19 21:18   UTC   HOLISTICA Vol 10 , Issue 2 , 201 9   
 
and attacking ’s, area which is nature just as the strategy for activity. It can 
confidently know  by knowing the profile of activities that drive the actions of the 
culprits (Kumar, & Somani, 2018) .  
The critical issue in “cyber terrorism” is the motivation to complete such an 
action on the Internet , that outcomes in savagery/damage to people and their 
property Dervojeda, Verzijl, Nagtegaal,  Lengton, & Rouwmaat, 2014) . It is by a 
portion of the segments. The terr orists of the world proceed  the upside of the 
cyber world with solid incentive as a stage with which they can use to dispatch 
more unusual  outbreak. Yunos and Ahmad (2014) said that with the utilization of 
Information and correspondence innovation, a terro rist could  present more 
noteworthy harms or exact the republic with troublesome conditions because of the interruption of necessary  administrations that the “cyberspace terrorist” 
causes more damage and devastation by the cyberspace than done the 
conventio nal strategy for terrorism.  
 
5.2. Motivating Factor of Cyber Terrorism  
The motivating factors of cyber terrorism give  as follows:  
5.2.1.  Websites’ Supportive Nature:  
The internet has viewed as a medium that is exceptionally tremendous, and 
that can in the meantime draw in light of a legitimate concern for some individuals 
to join some group of interest. The cyberterrorist prefers the utilization of the 
website as a res ult of its robust nature in that it can refer a message to a great 
many individuals inside a twinkle of an eye; they consider it to be a stage that is anything but difficult to select absorbed individuals.  
5.2.2.  Anonymity Nature of the internet:  
Anonymity is th e pivotal element that each evil culprit leans towards with 
the goal that their character could not be recognizable after playing out their 
devilish act.  The Internet is a sheltered domain just as concealing stage for the 
terrorist as they can stay unknow n so that their personality cannot be known.  
5.2.3.  Hacking:  
The overall term of all kinds of unapproved access to any "computer system" 
network organize is hacking that can occur in any structure all things measured as "cyber murder." A large number of these hac kers make use of a "brute force‟ 
which is the combinations of every single imaginable letter just as numbers and images till they get the password Sreenu, & Krishna, 2017) . 
 
121 
Unauthentifiziert   | Heruntergeladen  01.09.19 21:18   UTCHOLISTICA Vol 10 , Issue 2 , 201 9  
5.2.4.  Computer Viruses:  
These viruses are here and there scattered on a system to in other to do 
hurtful exercises. These may be to fill in as an administrative agent, create 
information or even split down the system.  
5.2.5.  Password Sniffing:  
The “Cyber terrorist” may use one of the technique such as password sniff 
as procedures to complete their “cyber -attack” on different countries and many 
big organizations to see their downfall and have control over their systems. The password sniffer is programming which uses to screen organize and in the meantime catch all the password that passes the s ystem connector.  
 
5.3. Consequences of “Cyber Terrorism”  
Cyber terrorism is an original type of cyber danger and attack that has many 
outcomes connected to it when propelled against any countries and associations. Some consequences of cyber terrorism define as follows:  
5.3.1.  Data Intrusion:  
The cyber terrorism can annihilate information honesty with the goal that 
the information could never again be trusted, pulverizing its classification as 
intruding on its accessibility. The expanding rate of this cyber terrorism i n 
encroaching associations and country's information has produced a ton of 
difficulties which has come about in loss of vitals and critical information that is typically difficult to recover (Sutton, 2017) . 
5.3.2.  The attack on Businesses:   
The cyber -terrorism could make associations lose billions of dollars in the 
region of organizations. The data arrangement of a bank can be attacked or hack through the terrorists who will prompt unapproved access to such financial balance and make them los e gigantic millions of dollars which can create such 
bank to keep running into bankruptcy (Gade, & Reddy, 2014).  
5.3.3.  Loss of Life:  
Cyber terrorism has guaranteed many acquitted lives and in the meantime 
render numerous homes to a condition of the problem that  is occasionally coming 
about to mental injury to the influenced families. The “cyber -terrorism” can in one 
method or alternate prompts the death toll just as causing severe harms. It has 
shown in an attack on the PCs utilization, networks’ as well as attacks that have

come about to the different types of blasts of a few plane accidents issues 
everywhere throughout the world which that has asserted numerous life (Cabaj, Kotulski, Księżopolski,  & Mazurczyk, 2018) . 
5.3.4.  Consumer Trust in Doubt:  
The development of  any organizations and its support relies upon the trust 
that its purchaser has on such association as trust can see tools that fortify association and certainty among associations and clients.  
 
6. Case Study Examples  
6.1. Cyber Security in E -Governance case study  
E-Governance is the extension of the efforts completed through the 
governments to recover relations with their nationals. With its instilled 
straightforwardness and receptiveness, given the standards of the Internet, E -
Governance conveys governments all the more near their residents. Existing and potential dangers in the circle of cybersecurity are among the most genuine difficulties of the 21st century. To ensure E -Governance extends there is a 
requirement for data security best practices (Hua, & Bap na, 2013) . Security 
policies, practices, and techniques must be set up just as the use of security technology. It helps to ensure e -Government systems against attack, recognizes 
great exercises administrations and to have a demonstrated alternate course of  
action set up. An open private organization is a vital part of cybersecurity in E -
Governance. These associations can conveniently go up against coordination issues. Powerful cyber -crime prevention and arraignment activities in all the ICT 
appropriate conditions.  
 
6.2. Kaspersky Kidnapping Case  
The “highest- profile” cyber surveillance, stalking, and kidnapping case 
included Ivan Kaspersky, child of the administrator and CEO of Russia -based 
Kaspersky Lab, a standout amongst the most unmistakable cybersecurity fir ms on 
the planet. Ivan Kaspersky was abducted for payoff in 2011 while strolling to work from his Moscow loft. As indicated by Russian media sources, beginners –  a more 
seasoned obligated couple –  organized the plot and enrolled their child and two 
of his companions as "muscle" for the plot (Cabaj, Kotulski, Księżopolski,  & 
Mazurczyk, 2018) . The abductors stalked Kaspersky and his sweetheart for a while 
preceding the seizing, deciding his conduct standards and finding that he did not 
 
123

have a protective secu rity detail. The hijackers supposedly acquired all the 
required data from Kaspersky's client profile on Vkontakte, a famous Russian 
social systems administration site. Kaspersky was compelled to call his dad to transfer the payoff requests (Gade, & Reddy, 2014) . The abductors may have 
utilized similar wireless to make food deliveries or had geolocation administrations empowered.  
 
6.3. Uber Case study  
Data breaches happen every day, in too many places, but the risk of data 
breach doesn't necessarily depend on the  number, it may also depend on the risk 
and damage it causes the company's revenue and impact on the users or account holders, one of the biggest recent data breaches is Uber.  
6.3.1.  Impact:  
One of the recent major cyber -attack is data breach of personal information 
of around 57million Uber users and 600,000 Uber drivers got revealed.  
 
6.3.2.  Details:  
The worst part of this attack is how the Uber handled the issue, this is a 
lesson to most companies what not to do. In late 2016 just two hackers were able 
to steel the Users personal data with includes names, phone numbers and email 
addresses.  They were able to steal the 600,000 driver's license information. 
Hackers got access to the Uber's GitHub account through a third- party cloud-
based service. With the details found from the GitHub, Hackers found a way to access Uber user data in AWS. Ubers paid those  two hackers $100, 000 to 
permanently destroy the whole data they obtained and not letting the users or the regulators about stolen information.  
But also, Uber confirmed that data was destroyed with the assurance they 
received from the hackers. According to US Law enforcement, any breach should be reported to the authorities and not pay hackers. And this kind of approach from Uber led other hackers to blackmail Netflix, where Hackers frightened to release TV shows unless the company paid the money hackers requested. Almost 49 states 
have this law enforcement where a security breach should be notified, after the court hearings Uber agreed to pay 20million to settle FTC charges. Not only the US 
but also other major countries like UK, Italy, and the Philippine s reacted on this

issue. Uber's breach is different from the regular breaches, the company tried to 
cover up the breach and not alert the authorities and the users.  
6.3.3.  Uber's plan after the breach:  
Khrosrowshabi the new CEO of Uber received few disputed problems only 
with respect to its legal issue also criticism for sexual harassment, underpaying the drivers and few more.  
 
6.3.4.  Solutions  
Some solutions regarding cyber security and cyber terrorism describe here:  
• Cyber Security Techniques  
Some techniques can use to improve cybersecurity.                                                                  
• Access control and “password security”:  The idea of password and user 
name has a primary method for ensuring data. It may be the principal 
measures concerning cybersecurity.  
• Data’s Authentication:  The documents that we get should dependably be 
validated be before transferring. It should check if it has begun from a critical and dependable source and that they are not modified (Gade, & Reddy, 2 014) . Verifying of these records is typically done by the “anti -
virus” software present in the gadgets. Subsequently, a decent “anti -
virus” software is likewise necessary to shield the gadgets from viruses.  
• Anti-virus software: It is a PC program that clas sifies, avoids, and makes a 
move to harm or evacuate noxious software programs, for instance, viruses as well as worms. Most "antivirus programs" comprise an "auto -
update" feature that authorizes the program to download profiles of new viruses with the obj ective that it can chequer for the new viruses when 
they find.  
• Malware scanners: This is software that typically filters each of the 
records and archives current in the framework for vindictive code or destructive viruses [10]. Viruses, worms, as well as T rojan horses, are 
instances of “malicious software” that regularly assemble and alluded to 
as malware.  
• Firewall: A “software program” or an equipment that helps monitor 
hackers, infections, and all types of worms which endeavour to achieve 
PC over the Inte rnet. All data which is transmitting to and fro over the 
web go through the firewall contemporary, which looks at every 
 
125

individual message and hinders which do not meet the security 
requirements and classify them as threat and try to block from the system 
and monitor the activities. Henceforth firewalls assume an essential job in recognizing the malware.  
6.4. Prevention of Cyber Terrorism  
The capacity to prevent cyber terrorism lies with the capacity to securely 
verify cyberspace. Cybersecurity has an intriguing parallel to terrorism. Both are 
lopsided. Guaranteeing the security of information, data, and correspondence is impressively harde r than hacking into a framework. The attacker has an 
inalienable preferred standpoint in both regular terrorism and cyber -attacks. On 
account of state -supported attacks, the difficulties are of a lot higher greatness 
(Cabaj, Kotulski, Księżopolski, & Mazur czyk, 2018) . Governments should guarantee 
that their rules smear to cybercrimes and be wholly actualized and hold fast to; it is essential that the countries of the biosphere take measures to guarantee that its punitive and technical law is satisfactory to  address the difficulties presented 
by cybercrimes (Kumar, & Somani, 2018) .  
The availability, confidentiality and the integrity of information in any 
associations are essential which endeavors must be set up to guarantee that they are exceptionally secure  because it is the significant cyber resource that makes 
each association stand and in the meantime depended upon. The information has entered by the “cyber -terrorist” is something beyond records which may 
incorporate messages, web applications, web pages,  and just as some 
indispensable operating systems. (Kumar, & Somani, 2018)  
 
7. Future Study and Scope  
      This paper will help to advance the scientific interests in the exploration 
of cybersecurity, particularly to respond to the procedural questions of the 
prediction of future data and actions significant to security patterns. This study sets the backgroun d to begin executing rules for all intentions as indicated through 
the usual security issues and answers for data systems. This paper consolidates many procedures connected and may be improved to serve cybersecurity regarding anticipating the operational l egitimacy of the methodologies of 
assessment benchmarks. Finally, the emphasis on limiting, recouping, and disposing of weakness is the primary, basic patterns, and reactions to the constant expanding progress (Panchanatham, 2015) . 
 
126 
Unauthentifiziert   | Heruntergeladen  01.09.19 21:18   UTC   HOLISTICA Vol 10 , Issue 2 , 201 9   
 
      Over the next five years, cyber -crime may create severe damage in 
information technology. According to the researchers they have estimated an 
approximate close to 6 trillion dollars loss. So, there would be a very bright scope for people who work and resolve the issues related to cyber -crime and provide all 
the necessary security measures. Big organizations like CISCO which is completely related to networking technology which is one of the top organization has approximately millions of openings relate d to cybersecurity because which is the 
future for the safety of Information technology. They are also wide opportunities in government -related fields and also defence field to save the countries secure 
data from cyber attackers.  
 
8. Conclusion  
      Cyber -security is both about the insecurity made by and through this new 
space and about the practices or procedures to make it (progressively) secure. 
Exertion to verify the cyberspace should give a definitive need else the "information technology" will not be vi ably used by clients. The terrorist of things 
to come will win the wars without discharging a shot just by crushing the country's necessary substructure if steps are not taken to handle the pervasiveness of the expansion in such a cyber -attack. They can br ing an unknown look into the lives of 
others, regardless of whether they live nearby or over the globe.  
      The “cyber -terrorism” can in one method or alternate prompts the death 
toll just as causing severe harms. Though social media can utilize for cyb ercrimes, 
these organizations cannot stand to quit utilizing social media as it assumes an essential role in the attention of an organization. Cyber terrorism has guaranteed numerous innocent lives and in the meantime render numerous homes to a condition o f the problem that is occasionally coming about to mental injury to the 
influenced families. Cyber terrorism stays vital issues of the present society. Not 
just that the battle against Cyber terrorism is falling behind, current cybercrime 
assaults are ending up progressively forceful and confrontational. Cybersecurity has an intriguing parallel to terrorism. Guaranteeing the security of information, data, and correspondence is impressively harder than hacking into a system.
