Abstract. This paper is intended to explore the research done on identifying the 
diseased plants and crops using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) 
techniques during last 10 years using bibliometric methods. In this study, we used 
Scopus database to analyze on “Plant disease” or “Crop disease” using “Machine 
Learning” or “Deep Learning” or “Neural Networks”. This paper focuses on the importance of ML and DL techniques in identifying plant or crop diseases. The database collected from the Scopus is analyzed using VOSviewer software of 
version 1.6.16. The study is limited to publications from conferences, journals with 
subject areas are limited to Computer Science, Engineering and languages limited to English and Chinese. Scopus search outputs 824 articles on Plant or Crop diseases 
with ML, DL and Neural Networks covering conference papers and journal articles. 
Statistics showed that more articles were published during the last five years and 
major contributions were from India. By analyzing database on Authors, Subject 
area, Keywords, Affiliation, Source type it is evident that there is plenty of research 
scope in this area. Network analysis on diverse parameters specifies that there is a 
good scope to do research in this topic using advanced deep learning techniques. 
Keywords. Crop Disease, Plant Disease, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural 
Networks, Network Analysis, Bibliometric Analysis. 
1. Introduction 
Diseases in plant, crop are the major concern in the agricultural sector, and their 
automatic detection is critical for their monitoring. Plants are extremely susceptible to 
seasonal illnesses, which worsen over time and under varying climatic conditions. As a result, it is critical to address the issue of safeguarding plants from a variety of illnesses. 
The leaves reflect the majority of disease symptoms; however leaf identification by 
professionals in laboratories is costly and time-consuming. Rice infections commonly cause yield losses of 20 to 40% and are closely associated to the global economy [1]. 
Rice disease diagnosis is still primarily done by hand. It’s vital to identify diseases 
quickly so that treatment can be planned and losses can be minimized.  
Many computer algorithms have been developed to detect plant diseases early in 
order to protect crops from damage. Extracted features are very important in both 
segmentation and categorization of infected areas in the Machine Learning, Deep Recent Developments in Electronics and Communication Systems

applicability in plant disease identification, providing a comprehensive instrument with 
extremely accurate findings. Since Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved outstanding results, deep CNN models are used to categorize and analyze 
diseases in plants from the leaves [4-8]. 
In this context, this paper presents a thorough assessment of the literature with the 
goal of determining the current state of the art in the application of ML, DL and CNN in the identification and classification of plant diseases, as well as identifying trends using 
Scopus database and VOSViewer software. 
2. Literature study 
In previous decades, the citation count of a paper was regarded the most essential 
indicator of its scientific effect, and it was regularly used to evaluate the work of faculty 
members, research institutions, and universities [9]. Counts are not simply a measure of 
influence, but they can also be used to scale the overall quality of research [10]. 
A deep CNN based modified LeNet proposed in [11] to carry experiments on maize 
leaf images of PlantVillage dataset. This CNN is trained on four classes and achieved an 
accuracy of 97.89%. In the work [12], the researchers described a test that was done in 
Sardinia using the DSS LANDS to forecast potato late light illness. The objective of the study was to see if using a Machine Learning technique, regional weather characteristics 
could be utilized to forecast potato late blight risk in southern Sardinia. The disease 
severity is forecasted with 96% accuracy using feed forward neural network with 
parameters provided by ARPAS weather stations.  
Citrus fruits quality and yield will decrease the “Citrus” disease. An effective 
segmentation and classification model for citrus plant disease is presented in the research [13]. Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) is used to categorize citrus disease 
using the selected features. The proposed model has been tested on the CDIG data and it outperformed other approaches and achieved superior outcomes on the test images. 
Identifying earliest symptoms of infections through visual examination or laboratory 
studies is one of the known strategies for minimizing loss due to plant illnesses. Using an infrared camera and an artificial neural network for image classification, researchers 
presented a low-cost, portable, and noninvasive plant health monitoring device in [14]. 
The first prototype was tested on a cassava plant to determine its photosynthetic activity, which is a good indicator of the plant’s current health. 
For the needed analysis, various analytical models such as Decision Tree, Random 
Forest, and Bayesian Neural Network are existing in the literature. These methods are applied for examining multidimensional, time-specific data in the agriculture segment in 
order to provide useful knowledge to help economic growth efforts [15-21].  
3. Database 
Data about the research work and publications can be obtained from popular repositories 
like Scopus, Web of Science, Scimago, Google Scholar etc. Among these Scopus 
database is the most popular and commonly used repository. Different keywords are used 
in the search and languages limited to English and Chinese. Another filter is on the year 
of publication with range May, 2021 to 2012.  Ch.V .Raghavendr anetal./Bibliometric Analysis onIdentifying Plant, CropDiseases 1144. Statistical analysis and results

In analyzing the Co-authorship with authors, documents with more than 25 authors 
are not considered. The min. no. of documents an author is made to two and these selected 
356 authors from the total 2308 authors. Few of 356 items in the network are not 
connected to one another and the major set of connected items contains of 144 items 
only. It is witnessed from the network diagram that, Zhang J. has highest no. of documents equal to 13. The Figure. 5 shows Co-authorship relationship with authors.  
In the selected documents, the researchers are from 1401 organizations and threshold 
set for network analysis is minimum number of documents per organization as two. This
